# JS: Object Oriented Programming

Your job in this workshop will be to write two sets of programs that catalog data in an Object-oriented style. First with cats, then with books.

We recognize that this is a difficult assignment given how fresh the concepts are! To make life a bit easier, we've provided some samples of OOP code. Check out the "samples" directory if you're feeling confused / not sure where to start.
