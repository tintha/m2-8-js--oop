// Exercise 2.3
//
// We want to be able to add books to our BookList, so that we can start a
// collection!
//
// Let's create an `add` method in our BookList class. It should take a book
// as a parameter. When we call `.add`, it should push that new book into the
// `books` array on the `BookList` class. Also, if no Book is being currently read
// we should set currentlyReading to point to this newly added Book.
//
// Books have an `isRead` property, to indicate if we've read it or not.
// Let's also add two new methods:
// - getNumRead
// - getNumUnread
//
// These methods should return the number of books which are read and unread,
// respectively.
//
// The following code will fail by default. Your goal is to get it to run, and output the values specified at the end:

const homeLibrary = new BookList();

// Books are unread by default:
homeLibrary.add(new Book("The Shining", "Horror", "Stephen King"));
homeLibrary.add(new Book("American Gods", "Fiction", "Neil Gaiman"));

// But, we can specify that we've read it:
homeLibrary.add(
  new Book("Eloquent JavaScript", "Programming", "Marijn Haverbeke", true)
);

// At this point, we should have 2 unread books, and 1 read book:
console.log(homeLibrary.getNumUnread()); // 2
console.log(homeLibrary.getNumRead()); // 1
