// Exercise 2.1
// ------------

// Create a Book class and then intantiate it 5 times with various books
// include the following properties in the constructor
//    - title (string)
//    - genre (string)
//    - author (string)
//    - isRead (boolean - whether or not you've read the book)
//
// Declare the books as book1, book2, book3, book4, book5
//
// If the book doesn't provide a value for `isRead`, it should default to
// `false`.
//
// Console.log them to verify that all is working.

class Book {}

console.log(book1, book2, book3, book4, book5);
