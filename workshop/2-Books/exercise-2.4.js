In our BookList, we have properties to track:
- The last book we've read
- The book we're currently reading
- The next book up

We're not using these properties yet; they're always null.

Our new task is to make them functional. When we add our first book to the
list, `currentlyReading` should get set to it.

We need two new methods:

- startReading
- finishReading

Both of these methods will take a book title, as a string.

When we start reading a book, we should set the `currentlyReading` property
to point to it.

When we finish reading a book, we should set `currentlyReading` back to `null`,
and set `lastRead` to the book we just finished.

Your goal is to add the methods and behaviour necessary so that the following
code runs well and produces the expected output.

homeLibrary.add(new Book('The Eire Affair', 'Fantasy', 'Jasper Fforde'));
homeLibrary.add(

console.log('initial state', homeLibrary.currentlyReading); // should be The Shining book object
console.log('initial last-read', homeLibrary.lastRead); // should be null

homeLibrary.finishReading('The Shining');
console.log(
